Introduction
============

This tool implements a minimal set of the Serial Download Protocol (SDP), used
on NXP i.MX SoC application processors, to load an executable image over USB.

The tool is aimed at [USB armory Mk II](https://github.com/usbarmory/usbarmory/wiki) users but should work
with all SoCs from the i.MX series capable of USB HID based SDP (only tested
devices are listed as supported, Pull Requests are welcome to expand this set).

The [mfgtools](https://github.com/NXPmicro/mfgtools) and
[imx_usb_loader](https://github.com/boundarydevices/imx_usb_loader) projects
also implement similar functionality.

Serial Download Protocol
========================

The `armory-boot-usb` command line utility allows to load an imx executable
through USB using [SDP](https://github.com/usbarmory/usbarmory/wiki/Boot-Modes-(Mk-II)#serial-download-protocol-sdp),
useful for testing or initial provisioning purposes.

You can automatically download, compile and install the utility, under your
GOPATH, as follows:

```
go install github.com/usbarmory/armory-boot/cmd/armory-boot-usb@latest
```

Alternatively you can manually compile it from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/usbarmory/armory-boot
cd armory-boot && make armory-boot-usb
```

The utility can be cross compiled for Windows as follows:

```
make armory-boot-usb.exe
```

Pre-compiled binaries for Linux and Windows are released
[here](https://github.com/usbarmory/armory-boot/releases).

The utility is meant to be used on devices running in
[USB SDP mode](https://github.com/usbarmory/usbarmory/wiki/Boot-Modes-(Mk-II)):

```
sudo armory-boot-usb -i armory-boot.imx
found device 15a2:0080 Freescale SemiConductor Inc  SE Blank 6ULL

```
